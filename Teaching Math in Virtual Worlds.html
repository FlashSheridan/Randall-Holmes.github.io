<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Course
Description</B></FONT></FONT> <FONT FACE="Arial Narrow"><FONT SIZE=3><B>and
Prerequisites:&nbsp;</B></FONT></FONT>&nbsp; <FONT FACE="Arial Narrow"><FONT SIZE=3>3
credits.&nbsp; This is an experimental course exploring the
possibility of mathematics instruction in virtual worlds, primarily
in Second Life.&nbsp; Class sessions will be conducted in Second Life
(two hour synchronous sessions each week, provisionally 3-5 SLT
Thursdays, but this may change), with some investigation of other
software options. &nbsp; Both opportunities and difficulties in the
communication of mathematical knowledge in 3D online environments
will be explored.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow"><FONT SIZE=3>Familiarity
and comfort with mathematics to the level of high school geometry,
algebra and trigonometry is required; the degree of mathematical
maturity required of a high school mathematics teacher would be
better.&nbsp; Calculus may appear in demonstration lessons (but I
would not say that knowledge of calculus is prerequisite) &nbsp; An
introduction to vectors in three dimensional space (without calculus)
would be useful.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow"><FONT SIZE=3>Requirements
include access to a computer capable of running Second Life (this
imposes requirements both on hardware and on one's Internet
connection) and the ability to meet with the class for synchronous
sessions in SL.&nbsp; It will be advisable to have an audio headset
since SL voice may be used.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Prerequisite Second Life skills (some
of these will be reviewed in class):<BR>&bull; Use of camera
controls<BR>&bull; Ability to fly, walk, and teleport<BR>&bull;
Knowledge of communication tools (IM and chat)<BR>&bull; Basic
building skills (create prims, add textures and content)<BR>&bull;
Basic inventory management (can find items, wear clothing, make a
notecard)<BR>&bull; It is recommended that participants have at least
15-20 hours of prior participation in Second<BR>Life before the
course begins.&nbsp; Please note that an account is free and these
skills can be acquired prior to the start of the class relatively
easily if one is interested in this class and new to virtual worlds.&nbsp;
Feel free to contact the instructor if you seek assistance with
this:&nbsp; the instructor is aware that the SL orientation process
can be a bit annoying, and can help to provide a better experience.</P>

Materials (including hardware/software requirements):&nbsp;&nbsp;
</B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow"><FONT SIZE=3>Participants
need a computer and internet connection capable of running Second
Life (and an audio headset if SL voice is used).&nbsp; The easiest
way to test this is to go to www.secondlife.com, set up an account
(this is free) and try running the software.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> <FONT FACE="Arial Narrow"><FONT SIZE=3>See</FONT></FONT>
http://secondlife.com/corporate/sysreqs.php</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Please note this important
disclaimer:&nbsp; &quot;Second Life'&quot; (with its abbreviation
&quot;SL'&quot;) is a trademark of Linden Labs, which operates this
virtual world.&nbsp; Second Life is a general-purpose environment:
students entering this environment may encounter adult content,
commercial solicitations, etc., which they may find annoying or
offensive.&nbsp; Boise State assumes no liability for such
experiences. Linden Labs rates sims on content (PG/Mature/Adult).
There is no reason that a visit to an Adult sim would be relevant to
this class. No student will be required to visit a Mature sim (PG
alternatives will be available), though it should be noted that a
Mature rating does not actually imply the presence of any potentially
offensive content, and if there is any potential for offense in a sim
of which the instructor is aware, students will be specifically
advised. Students, faculty and staff are expected to follow Second
Life Terms of Service. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Course documents, assignments and
asynchronous communication between the instructor and students and
between students will be hosted on the Ed Tech department's Moodle
site (this is a change, the syllabus originally said Blackboard
here). The EdTech Moodle site is at <A HREF="http://edtech.mrooms.org/">http://edtech.mrooms.org</A>
: if you go to Moodle tutorials there is a section for students. You
should actually have an account already if you are in this class, as
the tutorial explains, but you can also create one. I will send you
the enrollment key for this class in email.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Course
Objectives:</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow"><FONT SIZE=3>Students
will explore literature on teaching in virtual worlds in general and
what resources there are on the teaching of mathematics and related
subjects in particular.&nbsp; Students will be assigned an active
role in looking for literature related to the course topic.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow"><FONT SIZE=3>Students
will explore resources related to mathematics which are found in
Second Life and other relevant online resources.&nbsp; Again,
students will be assigned an active role in looking for such
resources</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow"><FONT SIZE=3>Students
will prepare and deliver instruction in mathematics at different
levels in Second Life:&nbsp; this is intended to include the
elementary (K-6) level and the higher level of high school or early
undergraduate instruction.&nbsp; This will include preparation of&nbsp;
lessons and design of instructional objects in the Second Life
environment.&nbsp; Students will take the student role in instruction
designed by other students and assess its effectiveness.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow"><FONT SIZE=3>There
will be some discussion of the mathematical underpinning of Second
Life itself (and of 3D online worlds in general), and of the
opportunities that the mathematical nature of the environment might
(or might not) give in teaching mathematics in the environment.&nbsp;
Note in this connection that the mathematical prerequisites for the
course (stated above) are limited, though a student with better
mathematics background might be able to use this knowledge in an
individual project.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow"><FONT SIZE=3>Students
will discover opportunities and difficulties associated with teaching
in this environment in general and specific opportunities and
difficulties related to the teaching of mathematics or related
subjects.</FONT></FONT></P>

will be expected to behave respectfully toward one another, the
instructor, and guests of or visitors to the class. This includes but
is not restricted to recognizing the rights of class participants to
represent themselves as they wish in SL, staying on topic (especially
when called to order by the instructor or a teaching assistant), and
not interrupting (especially with irrelevant content) when someone
else has the virtual &ldquo;floor&rdquo;. SL is a fun environment and
can be distracting; we are not planning to be grimly intent but we do
intend to stay on track.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Posting
of Assignments</B></FONT></FONT> &ndash; <FONT FACE="Arial Narrow"><FONT SIZE=3>Major

Most assignments in this class are delivered &quot;live&quot; in
Second Life or other computer environments.&nbsp; Where this is not
the case (as for example with a paper), electronic submissions to my
e-mail are appropriate.&nbsp; See below for a discussion of timely
assignment submission.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Feedback/grades</B></FONT></FONT>
&ndash;&nbsp; <FONT FACE="Arial Narrow"><FONT SIZE=3>Assignments will
be graded promptly (well within the department mandated interval of
one week).&nbsp; A student's current standing in the course will
always be available on request from the instructor, and will be
supplied privately to each student from time to time.</FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Late
assignments</B></FONT></FONT> &ndash;&nbsp; <FONT FACE="Arial Narrow"><FONT SIZE=3>The
instructor disclaims any consistent policy on late delivery of
assignments, other than that no assignment will be accepted after the
end of the course.&nbsp; The instructor may accept a late assignment
as if turned in on time (this is more likely the first time or in the
presence of an excellent reason for lateness).&nbsp; The instructor
may penalize an assignment for lateness or refuse to accept it at
all, at his entire discretion.&nbsp; It is best to turn in your
assignments on time.&nbsp; If you are aware in advance that you will
have to turn an assignment in late, please communicate with me:&nbsp;
this increases the likelihood of an accommodation.&nbsp; Please note
that attendance at the synchronous sessions is an essential part of
the course and missing class is as serious in its effects as turning
assignments in late.</FONT></FONT></P>
