Some of these may be published versions, some may be late drafts.<p>

In some cases, I am uncertain which is the best version.  This explains some apparent duplications.<p>

<LI> Set theory, philosophical or survey pieces<p>

The first two are on the philosophical motivation for NF.  The last two are general surveys of alternative set theories.<p>

it does have a connection to NF3, of course, but it is not really an NF paper.<p>

</UL>

<LI> Stratified combinatory logic and lambda-calculus<p>

This was the original program of my thesis, and led to the Watson program.<p>

</UL>

<LI> The Urysohn paper<p>

This was an isolated foray into mainstream mathematics.  The paper is based on my Masters thesis.  My advisor admitted later that it was really a PhD thesis, but it would have been quite disastrous for me to get a PhD thesis in functional analysis...without knowing any functional analysis!<p>

</UL>

<LI>  Set theory (stratified or typed)<p>

This has been my main line of work.  Substantial time spent thinking about the model theory of NFU is manifest in the strong axioms paper, with a footnote in the paper about models preserving information.  The tangled type theory paper is the start of my main line of attack on the consistency problem for NF itself.  The other papers touch on other consistent fragments of NF or important techniques in NF.  The acyclic comprehension paper is about a very peculiar proposal about the axiomatics of NFU...which turns out to work perfectly.  The Tarski's Theorem and NFU paper is an oddment.<p>

This paper also appears under the general NF set theory heading, but it says something about the type theory of PM.<p>
