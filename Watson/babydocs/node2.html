Introduction</A>
</H1>

<P>
Watson is a general-purpose system for formal reasoning.  It has been
developed with applications to software development or verification in
mind, but we have also considered applications in education or in pure
mathematics.  Earlier incarnations of the prover have been called
EFTTP (which was a very different system) and Mark2 (which was similar
though not identical to Watson; there are occasional references in the
paper to differences between Mark2 and Watson: the best reference
for Mark2 is the final report [<A
 HREF="node43.html#finalreport">16</A>] of Holmes's first ARO
grant).

<P>
Watson is a system for computer-supported reasoning by human beings
rather than for automatic proof of theorems, though it does support
the development of automated proof strategies.  

<P>
Its logic is equational and rewriting plays a considerable role in the
prover, though it is not a typical rewriting system.  The properties
of expressions defined by cases play an important role in its logic.

<P>
Watson supports a higher order logic, which is distinctive in being
type-free: it is a <IMG

 SRC="img1.gif"
 ALT="$\lambda $">-calculus equivalent to a variant of
Quine's set theory ``New Foundations''.  References for the
theoretical aspects of the higher order logic include Quine's
[<A
 HREF="node43.html#nf">25</A>] and Jensen's [<A
 HREF="node43.html#nfu">19</A>] for the original systems of set
theory and Holmes's [<A
 HREF="node43.html#trc">13</A>], [<A
 HREF="node43.html#stratified">15</A>] and [<A
 HREF="node43.html#textbook">17</A>]
for the development of the <IMG

 SRC="img1.gif"
 ALT="$\lambda $">-calculus version.

<P>
This paper contains an overview of the mathematical foundations of
Watson, followed by a discussion of the way these foundations are
implemented in the prover, from the standpoint of a user.  These two
sections take up most of the paper.  Two short sections, one on
experiences with the prover and one on the relationships of the prover
with other systems, complete the paper.

<P>
We are grateful for the support of the Army Research Office through
three separate grants. The designer of the system (Holmes) is grateful
to the other author for his work with the prover and for his work
supervising students, and to the students for their efforts in
learning and applying the system.  Specifically we wish to thank the
following students for their hours of work and dedication to this
project: at the University of Idaho we thank Sol Espinosa, Fongshing
Lam, Aaron Schneider, Kundala Shankar, and Minglong Wu; and at Boise
State University we thank Michael Parvin for his excellent help. The
University of Idaho research group owes a special thanks to Dr. Holmes
for his continued support of our efforts and tremendous contribution
to helping the students resolve problems arising in their work.
