Definitions in Watson</A>
</H3>

<P>
Constants, operators and ``type labels'' (retractions with strongly
cantorian range) can be defined in Watson.  Examples of the definition
commands have appeared in example sections above, where this seemed
appropriate.

<P>
The definition of an atomic constant as a complex term is straightforward:

<P>
<PRE>
- defineconstant "four" "2+2";

four:  
four  =  
2 + 2
four , 0
</PRE>
<P>
The prover checks for defects such as circularity in the proposed
definition and, if no error is found, proves a new theorem embodying
the definition.  When a constant is defined, the name of the new
theorem is the same as the name of the defined constant (which cannot
have been declared previously).

<P>
The issue of stratification arises in the definitions of functions and
operations.

<P>
<PRE>
- defineconstant "Double@?x" "?x+?x";

Double:  
Double @ ?x  =  
?x + ?x
Double , 0

- defineconstant "(Comp@?f,?g)@?x" "?f@?g@?x";

Comp:  
(Comp @ ?f , ?g) @ ?x  =  
?f @ ?g @ ?x
Comp , 0

- defineconstant "Comp2@?f,?g,?x" "?f@?g@?x";

Watson:  Format, declaration or stratification failure of 
proposed definition of Comp2@?f,?g,?x
</PRE>
<P>
While reading the two definitions of composition of functions, recall
that all operations have the same precedence and group to the right.
In the first definition of composition of functions, note that defined
functions can have lists of arguments and can be ``curried'' if the
types of their arguments warrant this.  In the second definition of
composition, we see a failure of stratification.

<P>
Operators can be defined similarly.

<P>
<PRE>
(* defining operators with ``flat'' type *)

- defineinfix "OR" "?x|?y" "~(~?x)&amp; ~?y";

OR:  
?x | ?y  =  
~ (~ ?x) &amp; ~ ?y
OR , 0

(* defining typed operators *)

- showdec "@";                (* show the declaration of 
                              the function application 
                              operator *)

Watson:  Reserved operator @ left type:  1 right type: 0

- definetypedinfix "CONV_APP" 0 1 "?x &lt;@ ?y" "?y @ ?x";

(* the integer parameters are the left and right types 
of the defined operator &lt;@ (the converse of application, 
which has left type 1 and right type 0, must have 
left type 0 and right type 1) *)

CONV_APP:  
?x &lt;@ ?y  =  
?y @ ?x
CONV_APP , 0

(* definition of opaque operators *)

- defineopaque "WEIRD" "?x +`? ?y" "(?x@?x)+?y@?y";

WEIRD:  
?x +`? ?y  =  
(?x @ ?x) + ?y @ ?y
WEIRD , 0
</PRE>
<P>
The name of the theorem defining an operator must be supplied as a
parameter to the <TT>defineinfix</TT> or <TT>definetypedinfix</TT> commands,
as we see in the examples.  The <TT>defineinfix</TT> command is used to
define ``flat'' infixes (those with left and right type of 0); the
<TT>definetypedinfix</TT> command is used to define infixes with
nontrivial left and right type, and takes the types of its arguments
as parameters.  Completely unstratified operations such as <TT>+`?</TT>
in the example above can also be defined as ``opaque'' operators; the
use of opaque operators in definitions and in contexts with bound
variables is extremely restricted, but they do have some applications.

<P>
The most complex form of definition in Watson is the facility of defining
``type labels'' (retractions onto strongly cantorian ranges).  The usual
restrictions of non-circularity and stratification in definitions of
functions and operators are first modified (the stratification requirements
are sharper) then extended with the requirement that the operation being
defined be shown to be a retraction.  We illustrate the definition of 
a type by defining the type of booleans (using a new identifier Bool
to avoid conflict with the type label bool declared above).

<P>
<PRE>
- start "?x||true,false";
- assign "?x" "?x||true,false";  (* sets up theorem 
                           that this operation is a 
                                      retraction *)
- ri "(!@CASEINTRO)@?x"; ex();
- top(); downtoleft "?x||?y,?z"; ri "1|-|1"; ex();
- top(); downtoright "?x||?y,?z"; ri "1|-|1"; ex();
- top(); ex();
- p "BOOLRETRACT";

BOOLRETRACT:  
(?x || true , false) || true , false  =  
?x || true , false
CASEINTRO , 0

- defineconstanttype "BOOLRETRACT" 
                        "Bool:?x" "?x||true,false";

Bool:  
Bool : ?x  =  
?x || true , false
Bool , CASEINTRO , 0
</PRE>
<P>
The thing to notice is that the defineconstanttype command takes as an
additional parameter a theorem witnessing the fact that the operation
being defined is a retraction.  The reason that Watson can tell that
this retraction has strongly cantorian domain has to do with technical
aspects of the way Watson determines whether case expressions are
stratified (it implicitly views the hypothesis of a case expression as
being restricted to a strongly cantorian domain).

<P>
It is possible to define functions and operations which generate type
labels (type constructors).  There are subtleties with the use of type
constructors which make it necessary to declare constructors as ``opaque''
operators.
