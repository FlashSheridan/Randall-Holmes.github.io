The handling of variable binding:  de Bruijn levels
and the formal definition of substitution</A>
</H3>

<P>
As we noted above, the term construction using brackets represents
<IMG
 WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.gif"
 ALT="$\lambda $">-abstraction.  There is nothing in Watson's notation
corresponding to the <IMG
 WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img41.gif"
 ALT="$\lambda x$">
component of the notation 
<!-- MATH: $(\lambda
x.T)$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="50" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.gif"
 ALT="$(\lambda x.T)$">;
the variable bound in a bracket is determined by the syntax of
its context using a scheme due to deBruijn (but differing from the
most familiar name-free binding scheme due to deBruijn).

<P>
The variable bound in an outermost set of brackets is always <TT>?1</TT>;
the variable bound in a set of brackets which is in the scope of one
set of brackets is <TT>?2</TT>; in general, the variable bound in a set
of brackets which is enclosed in <TT>n-1</TT> further brackets is <TT>?n</TT>.  For example, the constant function 
<!-- MATH: $(\lambda x.x)$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="48" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img42.gif"
 ALT="$(\lambda x.x)$">
is written
<TT>[?1]</TT>, but its constant function 
<!-- MATH: $(\lambda y.(\lambda x.x))$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="82" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img43.gif"
 ALT="$(\lambda y.(\lambda x.x))$">
is
written <TT>[[?2]]</TT> (because the bound variable in this term is bound
by the inner of the two sets of brackets).

<P>
This scheme (which we have seen referred to as ``de Bruijn levels'')
has two advantages.  The first advantage is that it is not necessary
to manage binding with arbitrary variables, which leads to a complex
implementation and a very complex definition of substitution.  The
advantage that this scheme has over the more popular of de Bruijn's
schemes (de Bruijn indices) is that the variable bound in a given
bracket is represented in the same way wherever it appears.  The
disadvantage of de Bruijn levels (which de Bruijn indices do not have)
is that the bound variables in a term may need to be renumbered when
it is substituted into a different term.  So far, users of Watson (and
Mark2) have found the de Bruijn level scheme to be usable in practice;
what pressure the designer has felt from users to convert to the usual
variable-binding scheme has been relieved by the availability of
a tactic provided in the libraries which readily converts bracket
terms to a form more like the usual form when nesting of brackets is
sufficient to cause confusion.

<P>
The use of de Bruijn levels creates a complication of the definition
of substitution in a much more pervasive way than the similar problem
that arises with the numbering of hypothesis tactics.  On the other
hand, the complication is simpler than the one that would be
occasioned by use of the usual variable binding schemes.  For users
the system adopted is certainly better than de Bruijn indices, but
admittedly less readable than the usual schemes of variable binding
when there is enough nesting of abstraction terms (but, as noted
above, there is a tactic which converts such terms to a more readable
form).

<P>
When we consider an occurrence of a subterm in a larger term, we
define its <EM>level</EM> as the number of bracket terms of which it is
a proper subterm, and its <EM>hlevel</EM> (for ``hypothesis level'') as
the number of branches of case expressions of which it is a
(not necessarily proper) subterm.

<P>
The semantics of bound variables requires that each bound variable
<TT>?n</TT> appear only in contexts contained in at least <TT>n</TT> bracket
terms (the ``bound variable'' <TT>?0</TT> can appear in any context; it
is used for special purposes by internal functions of the prover not
discussed in this paper).  This is enforced by the declaration
checking functions of the prover.  An analogous requirement could be
imposed on hypothesis tactics, but is not in practice: no harm can be
done by meaningless hypothesis tactics, and we are interested in
allowing natural numbers to be passed as parameters to the <TT>|-|</TT>
operator in tactics, which would be forbidden if declaration checking
of hypothesis tactics were to be enforced.

<P>
We define what it means (and under what circumstances it is possible)
to substitute a term <TT>T</TT> found at level <I>l</I><SUB>1</SUB> and hlevel <I>h</I><SUB>1</SUB> (in
some larger term) into a context found at level <I>l</I><SUB>2</SUB> and hlevel <I>h</I><SUB>2</SUB>in a term <TT>U</TT>.  One circumstance under which such a substitution is
impossible is that in which a variable free in the term <TT>T</TT> becomes
bound in its new context when <TT>T</TT> is substituted into <TT>U</TT>.  A bound
variable <TT>?n</TT> is free in <TT>T</TT> iff 
<!-- MATH: $n \leq l_1$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="46" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img44.gif"
 ALT="$n \leq l_1$">;
it becomes bound
(or meaningless) in its new context in <TT>U</TT> if <I>n</I> &gt; <I>l</I><SUB>2</SUB>; thus,
substitution is impossible if any bound variable <TT>?n</TT> appears in
<TT>T</TT> with 
<!-- MATH: $l_2 < n \leq l_1$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="79" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img45.gif"
 ALT="$l_2 < n \leq l_1$">.
A similar restriction is imposed on
indices of hypothesis tactics in relation to hlevel.  Each variable
bound in <TT>T</TT> (i.e., <TT>?n</TT> with <I>n</I> &gt; <I>l</I><SUB>1</SUB>) is enclosed by <I>n</I>brackets in the term of which <TT>T</TT> is a subterm, while it is enclosed
in <I>n</I>-<I>l</I><SUB>1</SUB>+<I>l</I><SUB>2</SUB> brackets in the term <TT>U</TT>; thus its index must be
changed from <I>n</I> to <I>n</I>-<I>l</I><SUB>1</SUB>+<I>l</I><SUB>2</SUB> (while the indices of locally free
bound variables remain the same).  Precisely analogously, hypothesis
tactic indices &gt;<I>h</I><SUB>1</SUB> are translated by <I>h</I><SUB>2</SUB>-<I>h</I><SUB>1</SUB>.

<P>
The definition of substitution used by Watson is somewhat further
complicated by the issue of ``higher-order matching'' discussed below.
