Experience with mathematical content areas</A>

<P>
The Watson prover has been used to develop theories of propositional
and predicate logic in several styles.  An equational style (as
exemplified in [<A
 HREF="node43.html#gries">12</A>]) is most natural, and theories
implementing the propositional and predicate logic chapters of
[<A
 HREF="node43.html#gries">12</A>] in detail exist. We have also implemented a sequent
calculus and a goal driven natural deduction prover.  A tableau
approach to first-order logic has natural relationships with Watson's
built-in logic of case expressions, and a tableau approach to
propositional logic has been used to develop a complete tautology
checker as a tactic.  A goal-directed natural deduction prover has
been implemented as an interactive tactic using the <TT>INPUT</TT>
command.

<P>
Watson's notation for propositional logic presents no difficulties.
Experience leads us to believe that users can readily adapt to the
somewhat nonstandard notation for quantifiers.  There are few problems
with the stratification functions of the prover as long as the boolean
type has been declared as strongly cantorian and the propositional
connectives and quantifiers made scin or scout as appropriate.

<P>
The prover has been used to develop theories of basic arithmetic and
algebra needed for the projected computer science applications.
Watson readily supports algebraic reasoning; its case expression
machinery allows a natural way to handle exceptions to algebraic rules
(such as those occasioned by the need to avoid division by zero) which
are usually ignored by computer algebra systems, making the typical
CAS logically unsound.  We have also shown that Watson is a practical
environment for carrying out proofs by induction in a development of
Peano arithmetic. A theory of program semantics based on [<A
 HREF="node43.html#cohen">6</A>]
is under construction.  A student has recently completed a master's
project involving the verification of published proofs of security
properties of communication protocols using Watson.

<P>
For example, students working on this project have been able to
develop the following theory files (this list is not exhaustive):

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Sets:</STRONG>
<DD>Sets are defined as abstractions from boolean terms
(predicates), and set membership as a specialization of function
application. A library of elementary theorems has been developed
covering the topics of set membership, equivalence, complements,
unions, intersections, differences, subsets, proper subsets, and
disjoint sets.  On a more purely mathematical note, the designer used
the student work described above in a proof of the
Schr&#246;der-Bernstein theorem.
<DT><STRONG>NatOrder:</STRONG>
<DD>A theory file related to the order properties of
natural numbers (requiring proofs by induction).
<DT><STRONG>Bit Values:</STRONG>
<DD>A theory file that contains definitions and
theorems to assist in the mapping between compositions of Boolean
values (bit strings) and natural numbers to be used in hardware
circuit specification and verification.
<DT><STRONG>Gates:</STRONG>
<DD>A theory of basic gates, including and, or, xor, inv,
nand, nor and multiplexors. This also includes a theory covering
boolean algebra for the basic logic gates. Specifically this file
focuses on the composition and comparison of basic gates including
associativity and symmetry laws as well as De Morgan laws for the
gates.
<DT><STRONG>Protocols:</STRONG>
<DD>With help from the authors, a student has developed
a theory of protocol specifications and verification based on the
CAPSL specification language [<A
 HREF="node43.html#capsl">1</A>] and the SvO logic
[<A
 HREF="node43.html#svo">26</A>].  An interesting aspect of this project was that it
required the implementation of a modal logic (of belief) under Watson,
which proved possible despite the designer's doubts.
<DT><STRONG>Program Semantics:</STRONG>
<DD>The designer and a student have been
collaborating on a file which implements a theory of program semantics
in the style promoted by Dijkstra and Gries, following [<A
 HREF="node43.html#cohen">6</A>].
This file has involved extensive use of the higher-order features of
the prover, since reasoning about complex function types is involved.
</DL>
<P>
The designer has developed a theory of synthetic combinatory logic,
with a variety of different abstraction and reduction tactics, which he
hopes to use as a research tool in collaboration with a specialist in
this area.  The fact that the prover is good for this application area
is not surprising, as the development of the control structures of the
tactic language was largely driven by the now abandoned attempt to use
a synthetic combinatory logic rather than a <IMG

logic of the prover.
