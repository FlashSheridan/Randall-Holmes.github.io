View management and theorem export:</A>
</H2>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>declareview:</STRONG>
<DD>This command takes a single string argument.  A
new view is declared, named by the argument, translating all
predeclared constants and operators to themselves.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>restoreview:</STRONG>
<DD>This command takes a single string argument.  The
view named by the argument is restored from a backup view (backup views
are saved by <B>exportthm</B>).  To be used when an export fails.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>backupview:</STRONG>
<DD>This command takes a single string argument.  A
backup view is created for the view named by the argument.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>addtoview:</STRONG>
<DD>This command takes three string arguments.  It adds
a line to a view's translation table: the second argument (a constant
or operator) is to be translated by the third argument (a constant or
operator) in the view named by the first argument.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>dropfromview:</STRONG>
<DD>This command takes two string arguments.  It
drops the translation of the second argument (if any) from the view
named by the first argument.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>dropview:</STRONG>
<DD>This command erases the view named by its single
string argument (if any).

<P>
<DT><STRONG>exportthm:</STRONG>
<DD>This command takes four string arguments.  The first
is a view.  The second is the name of a theory on the desktop.  The
third is a suffix to be used to modify names of constants to avoid
name collision (<TT>#</TT> is always used as a prefix to modify names of
operators to avoid name collisions).  The last is the name of a
theorem in the current theory.  The command cosntructs the list of
theorems which need to be exported to export the theorem argument,
moves to the remote theory argument, checks and extends the view as
needed to carry out the export, then translates the list of theorems.
This command may be somewhat unstable; it seems to work and to be much
faster than it was under Mark2.

<P>
</DL>[declareview:] This command takes a single string argument.  A
