Fine points of matching:  limited higher order matching and commutative matching</A>
</H3>

<P>
This section is devoted to two refinements of matching, one integral to
Watson and the other optional.

<P>
A theorem in the current Watson library is the unsurprising

<P>
<PRE>
FORALLDIST:  

forall @ [(?P @ ?1) &amp; ?Q @ ?1]  =  
(forall @ [?P @ ?1]) &amp; forall @ [?Q @ ?1]
</PRE>
<P>
A term to which this theorem ought to apply is <BR><TT>forall@[(?1=?1)&amp;?1=?1]</TT>;
application of the theorem should yield <BR><TT>(forall@[?1=?1])&amp;forall@[?1=?1]</TT>.
And indeed it does:

<P>
<PRE>
- s "forall@[(?1=?1)&amp;?1=?1]";

{forall @ [(?1 = ?1) &amp; ?1 = ?1]}
forall @ [(?1 = ?1) &amp; ?1 = ?1]

- ri "FORALLDIST"; ex();

{(forall @ [?1 = ?1]) &amp; forall @ [?1 = ?1]}
(forall @ [?1 = ?1]) &amp; forall @ [?1 = ?1]
</PRE>
<P>
However, this would not have worked in early versions of Mark2 (the
precursor of the present Watson prover), where this proof would have
taken the following form:

<P>
<PRE>
- s "forall@[(?1=?1)&amp;?1=?1]";

{forall @ [(?1 = ?1) &amp; ?1 = ?1]}
forall @ [(?1 = ?1) &amp; ?1 = ?1]

- right();right();

forall @ [{(?1 = ?1) &amp; ?1 = ?1}]
(?1 = ?1) &amp; ?1 = ?1

- right(); ri "BIND@?1"; up(); left(); ri "BIND@?1"; ex();

forall @ [{([?2 = ?2] @ ?1) &amp; [?2 = ?2] @ ?1}]
([?2 = ?2] @ ?1) &amp; [?2 = ?2] @ ?1

- top(); ri "FORALLDIST"; ex();

{(forall @ [[?2 = ?2] @ ?1]) &amp; forall @ [[?2 = ?2] 
         @ ?1]}

(forall @ [[?2 = ?2] @ ?1]) &amp; forall @ [[?2 = ?2] 
      @ ?1]

- left();right();right();ri "EVAL";
	top();right();right();right();ri "EVAL"; top(); ex();

{(forall @ [?1 = ?1]) &amp; forall @ [?1 = ?1]}
(forall @ [?1 = ?1]) &amp; forall @ [?1 = ?1]
</PRE>
<P>
The difficulty with the old version of the prover (and with the
intuition that leads one to believe that the application shown is a
direct application of the theorem) is that <TT>?P@?1</TT> and <TT>?Q@?1</TT> are each
expected to match <TT>?1=?1</TT>, which they do not in any obvious syntactical
sense.  This was a serious problem for fluent reasoning with
quantifiers (and also caused unnecessary work in other applications of
functions).  (It is also important to note that <TT>forall@[?P&amp;?Q]</TT>
is not a candidate to match <TT>forall@[(?1=?1)&amp;?1=?1]</TT> at all,
because <TT>[?P&amp;?Q]</TT> is a constant function; the variables <TT>?P</TT>
and <TT>?Q</TT> can only match terms not depending on <TT>?1</TT> at all).

<P>
The solution was to adopt a limited form of higher-order matching: in
the context where <TT>?n</TT> is the highest-numbered bound variable, the
expression <TT>?P@?n</TT>, where <TT>?P</TT> is a free variable, will match
any expression in <TT>?n</TT> which can be expressed as a function of
<TT>?n</TT> (stratification restrictions are at work here): the free
variable <TT>?P</TT> will be matched to a suitable abstraction term.  A
modification of substitution which causes reductions to occur in terms
of the form <TT>?P@?n</TT> when an abstract is substituted for <TT>?P</TT>
is also needed.  With these modifications of matching and
substitution, we get the natural behaviour illustrated in the first
example above.

<P>
Recently, we have implemented further refinements of higher-order
matching and correlated improvements in substitution, which allow
natural treatments of situations involving multiple bound variables as
arguments, both when the arguments are curried and when they occur in
tuples.

<P>
A further point is that new variables introduced by the application of
theorems or tactics inside bracket terms may have an unexpected form:
under certain conditions, a ``new variable'' introduced at level <I>n</I>will take the form <TT>?x_1 @ ?n</TT> rather than the form <TT>?x_1</TT>
which one expects.  It is better to avoid the use of theorems which
introduce new variables in such contexts (in fact, it is always better
to avoid the introduction of new variables except in interactive
``scratch work''); it is possible that a stratification error will
result from such a theorem application (the type checking done uses an
imperfect heuristic to guess whether the new variable has correct
relative type); such errors are caught by the prover and cause the
theorem application to fail, and can always be avoided by avoiding the
introduction of new variables (by using parameterized versions of
theorems and their converses, either user developed or constructed
using the <TT>!@</TT> and <TT>!$</TT> built-in operators).  It would be
possible to redesign Watson to avoid stratification errors of this
kind, but it would involve a considerable elaboration of the data
structures representing context information in the prover for a very
limited benefit.

<P>
An optional refinement of matching which is available is commutative
matching, which can be turned on (or off) with the <TT>cmatch</TT>
command.  With commutative matching on, the prover will in effect
attempt to apply commutative laws wherever possible in the attempt to
apply a theorem.  A simple example:

<P>
<PRE>
- s "?x+?y+?z";

{?x + ?y + ?z}
?x + ?y + ?z

- ri "ASSOC"; ex();      (* ASSOC does not apply *)

{?x + ?y + ?z}
?x + ?y + ?z

cmatch();  (* this turns on commutative matching *)

- ri "ASSOC"; ex();       (* an application of COMM 
                          gives a term to
                          which ASSOC can be applied *)

{?y + ?z + ?x}
?y + ?z + ?x
</PRE>
<P>
An important fact about commutative matching is that it is not applied
in certain contexts even when it is turned on: for example, the
alternative and on-success rule infixes use strict matching to
determine whether a theorem succeeds or fails.  The additional freedom
of commutative matching would disrupt the control structures of the
internal programming language too much (for example, the generalized
associativity tactic given above would fail, because it depends on
ASSOC to fail on sums whose left term is not a sum).

<P>
We are not convinced that commutative matching is a useful refinement
of the prover (largely because of its conflicts with the needs of the
tactic language), but we continue to experiment with it.
