Experiences of users</A>

<P>
The Watson prover has a shallow initial learning curve.  Undergraduate
students can learn to prove equational theorems in an algebraic style
with the prover quite rapidly.

<P>
The more complex case expression and stratified abstraction facilities
seem also to be accessible to the advanced undergraduate and graduate
math and CS students who have been users of the system.

<P>
The use of the tactic language to write complex recursive tactics has
been mostly confined to the designer and one student.  All users have
been able to make effective use of tactics provided in libraries.

<P>
Users do not seem to have trouble with the default order of operations of
the prover, but we have provided full support for conventional order of 
operations for applications (such as those in education) where the use
of conventional order of operations would be advisable.

<P>
Users do not seem to have trouble with the use of deBruijn levels in
place of conventional variable binding; those who have done reasoning
with quantifiers or higher-order functions seem to have adapted to
this.  Since de Bruijn levels are a notational variant on the usual
treatment of bound variables (we believe it would be harder to adapt
to deBruijn indices), we don't find this surprising.  A tactic is
available in the libraries which makes the notation for abstracts look
more like standard notation: this tactic decorates each bracket term
with a null occurrence of the variable bound in it at its head (e.g.,
<TT>[?1 + ?1] becomes [?1.?1 + ?1]</TT>, where the defining theorem of
the connective <TT>.</TT> is <TT>?x.?y = ?y</TT>.  Another tactic removes
the annotations supplied by the first tactic.

<P>
The tactic language has been useful in several contexts.  A
tautology-checking tactic has been used extensively.  Recently, we
have implemented type inference algorithms as tactics in a theory of
natural numbers, integers, rationals and reals in which manipulation
of type labels (retractions with strongly cantorian range) was
becoming burdensome.  The use of tactics for application of theorems
to subterms of the selected term, composition and conversion of
tactics, and global rewriting (of more than one variety) is
ubiquitous.

<P>
Watson theories can be saved and retrieved in two different ways.  If
one is only interested in the theorems in a theory, there are <TT>storeall</TT> and <TT>load</TT> commands which respectively store and
retrieve the theorems of a given theory.  If one is interested in the
details of proofs (especially if one needs to change a theory by
modifying the details of proofs) the correct approach is to develop a
proof script in a text editor.  Originally, proof scripts were run
under ML using its <TT>use</TT> command, but this was too slow.  The
prover now has its own <TT>script</TT> command which reads scripts (which
are also usually readable by the ML interpreter).  Scripts can be
nested in a way which supports the development of libraries of
theories, though the modularity provided is not very sophisticated.

<P>
A refinement we have considered but not implemented (due to the ease
of use of proof scripts) is the development and storage of ``proof
objects'' which would represent proofs in a way which could be
manipulated by prover functions rather than a text editor.  There is a
natural way to do this in Watson (proofs could be represented as
tactics) but there is as yet little need for this.

<P>
Multiple theorems under construction in multiple theories can be
stored on the desktop at the same time in a Watson session; this
facilitates development work.

<P>
There is a facility, little-used so far, which can be used to prove
theorems in one theory by analogy with theorems from another: if the
user provides a match between primitives and axioms of a source theory
and concepts and theorems of a target theory, theorems of the source
theory can be exported to the target theory (with automatic
translation of notions of the source theory to notions of the target
theory as needed).  This theorem export facility also allows the
export of tactics; if a tactic is exported, all of the subtactics it
needs will automatically be exported as well.  We believe that this
facility of the prover will become more important as mathematical
libraries grow more extensive.  We have used it in one place in the
publicly available libraries to transfer a proof of complete
induction and related principles between theories with conflicting
notation.
