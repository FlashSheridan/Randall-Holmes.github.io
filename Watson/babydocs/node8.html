The intriguing feature of these equations is that the relative type of
<I>P</I> on the two sides of each equation is different; in fact, any
expression whose value is a truth-value can have its type freely
raised or lowered by any amount by application of these equations,
which suggests that a more liberal criterion of stratification is
possible where certain subterms are known to represent truth values.

<P>
The fact about the set of truth values indicated in the paragraph
above is stated in the terminology of <EM>NF</EM> and related set
theories as ``the set of truth values is <EM>strongly Cantorian</EM>''.
Formally speaking, the defining characteristic of a strongly Cantorian
set <I>A</I> is that the restriction of the constant function constructor
to the set <I>A</I> is realized by a function.  We say ``realized by a
function'' because all functions in our logic have universal domain
and may be applied to objects other than elements of the set <I>A</I>.  We
can sharpen this by using retractions (functions <IMG
 WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"

 ALT="$\tau$">
such that

<!-- MATH: $\tau(\tau(x)) = \tau(x)$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="106" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img37.gif"
 ALT="$\tau(\tau(x)) = \tau(x)$">
for all <I>x</I>) with range <I>A</I> to represent sets
<I>A</I>.  We then can define a (nonempty) strongly Cantorian domain as the
range of a retraction <IMG
 WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img36.gif"
 ALT="$\tau$">
such that there is a function <IMG
 WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img38.gif"
 ALT="$\kappa$">such that 
<!-- MATH: $\kappa(\tau(x)) = (\lambda y.\tau(x))$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="141" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img39.gif"
 ALT="$\kappa(\tau(x)) = (\lambda y.\tau(x))$">
for all <I>x</I>.

<P>
The importance of strongly Cantorian sets in set theories like <EM>NF</EM>, and of strongly Cantorian domains in stratified
<IMG
 WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.gif"
 ALT="$\lambda $">-calculus, is that comprehension or abstraction over these
sets is less affected by stratification restrictions.  Moreover, they
are closed under operations precisely analogous to the type
constructors under which we would want data types to be closed in
computer science: the realm of strongly Cantorian sets is closed under
cartesian product, power set, and the set theoretical analogue of the
arrow type constructor.  It contains all concrete finite sets.  The
assertion that the set of natural numbers is strongly Cantorian is
consistent with our stratified <IMG
 WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.gif"
 ALT="$\lambda $">-calculus (though it
strengthens it somewhat) and implies further that any set we are
likely to want to use as a data type in computer science (or, indeed,
in most of mathematics outside of technical set theory) is strongly
Cantorian.  This assertion completes the underlying logic of Watson.

<P>
Just as in the case of the truth values above, any term whose value is
guaranteed to belong to a fixed strongly Cantorian set may have its
relative type freely raised or lowered in determining stratification
of a <IMG
 WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.gif"
 ALT="$\lambda $">-term.  It turns out to be a practical necessity for the
handling of quantification that the stratification-checking features
of Watson be able to recognize at least the type of truth-values as a
strongly Cantorian domain, and we went ahead and incorporated a
feature of the prover supporting the recognition of general strongly
Cantorian domains, which will be discussed further below.  As hinted
in the preceding paragraph, computer science data types are expected
to be represented in theories developed under Watson as strongly
Cantorian domains; retractions with strongly Cantorian range are
used as type labels.

<P>
There is a discussion of the theory behind the representation of
data types using strong Cantorian domains in chapter 23 of our book
[<A
