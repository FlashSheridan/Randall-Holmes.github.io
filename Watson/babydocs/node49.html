Declaration Commands:</A>
</H2>

<P>
It is useful to note that variable operators can be assigned relative
types, strict prefix status and/or opacity using the operator
declaration commands.

<P>
<DL>
<DD><P>
<DT><STRONG>declaretypedinfix:</STRONG>
<DD>This command takes three arguments, two
integers followed by a string.  The string argument is declared as an
operator (if it has the correct form and is not already declared) with
the left type and right type indicated by the first and second integer
arguments, respectively.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>declareinfix:</STRONG>
<DD>This command takes a single string argument.  The
string is declared as an operator (if possible) and assigned left type
and right type of 0.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>declareopaque:</STRONG>
<DD>This command takes a single string argument.
The string is declared as an opaque operator, if of the correct form
and not already declared.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>declareprefix:</STRONG>
<DD>This command takes two string arguments.  The
first is intended to be an infix operator (already declared) and the
second a constant or numeral.  The operator argument is overloaded as
a prefix operator, with the second argument serving as the default
left argument of terms built with the operator as a prefix.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>declaretypedunary:</STRONG>
<DD>This command takes an integer argument and a
string argument.  The string is declared as a strict prefix operator,
if it is of the correct form and has not already been declared, with
right type determined by the integer argument. <B>dtu</B> is an
abbreviation for <B>declaretypedunary</B>.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>declareunary:</STRONG>
<DD>This command takes a single string argument.  The
string is declared as a strict prefix operator, if it is of the
correct form and has not already been declared, with right type 0.
<B>du</B> is an abbreviation for <B>declareunary</B>.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>declareunaryopaque:</STRONG>
<DD>This command takes a single string
argument.  The string is declared as an opaque strict prefix operator,
if it is of the right form and has not already been declared.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>defaulttypeinfo:</STRONG>
<DD>This command takes two string arguments, a
free variable and a constant.  The ``default type'' of the free
variable is set to the constant: this has the effect that the <TT>:</TT>
operator may be used as a prefix before that variable, and the type
retraction will be understood.  <B>dti</B> is an abbreviation for <TT>defaulttypeinfo</TT>.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>notypeinfo:</STRONG>
<DD>This command takes a single string argument, a free
variable.  Any default type assigned to that free variable is
cancelled.  <B>nti</B> is an abbreviation for <B>notypeinfo</B>.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>declareconstant:</STRONG>
<DD>This command takes a single string argument, a
constant.  The argument is declared as an atomic constant term, if it
is of the right form and has not already been declared.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>declarepretheorem:</STRONG>
<DD>This command takes a single string argument,
a constant or operator.  The argument is declared as a ``pretheorem''
(the intention is signalled that a theorem with this name will
eventually be proved), as long as it is of the correct form and has
not already been declared.  <B>dpt</B> is an abbreviation for <B>declarepretheorem</B>.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>declareunarypretheorem:</STRONG>
<DD>This command takes a single string
argument, an operator.  The argument is declared as a pretheorem and
as strict prefix, as long as it is of the correct form and has not
already been declared.  <B>dupt</B> is an abbreviation for <B>declareunarypretheorem</B>.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>makescin:</STRONG>
<DD>This command takes two string arguments, an operator
and a theorem.  The operator is declared ``scin'' if the theorem is of
the correct form.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>makescinleft, makescinright:</STRONG>
<DD>As <TT>makescin</TT>, but the
operator is declared ``scinleft'' or ``scinright'' as appropriate.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>makescout:</STRONG>
<DD>This command takes two string arguments, an operator
and a theorem.  The operator is declared ``scout'' if the theorem is
of the correct form.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>makescinvar:</STRONG>
<DD>This command takes a single string argument, an
operator variable, which is made ``scin''.  The uses of this are
technical and may be obsolete.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>setprogram:</STRONG>
<DD>This command takes two string arguments.  The first
is the name of a function or operator.  The second is the ``functional
program'' to be bound to that function or operator.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>deprogram:</STRONG>
<DD>This command takes one string argument.  It is the
name of a function or operator from which any ``functional program''
is to be unbound.
