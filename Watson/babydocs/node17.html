<H3><A NAME="SECTION00042200000000000000">
The basic session model of Watson</A>
</H3>

<P>
A typical Watson session begins with a user entering a term.  The user
then manipulates the term by applying theorems to subterms of this
term as rewrite rules (all Watson theorems are equations), and closes
by proving a theorem to the effect that the term originally entered is
equal to the term finally arrived at.

<P>
There are two moves available to the user which qualify this picture:
he may interchange the term originally entered and the term most
recently arrived at, or he may carry out a global substitution of some
term for a free variable, which will affect the term originally
entered as well as the term most recently arrived at.

<P>
Though it appears to the user that he is ``editing'' a term, what he
is actually editing is an equation.  Internally, the prover stores two
terms, the left side and right side of the equation being edited.
What the user views is the right side of the equation (there is also a
command available to view the left side).  There is a command which
interchanges the left and right sides of the equation, and there is a
global assignment command which replaces a free variable by the same
term everywhere in the equation; all other commands manipulate the
right side only.  At the end of the session, the user proves the
current equation: he assigns a name to it and it is stored as a new
rewrite rule available for the proof of further theorems.

<P>
We reproduce the rules of equational reasoning from above and point out
how they are implemented in the basic session model:

<P>
<DL>
<DD><P>
<DT><STRONG>reflexivity:</STRONG>
<DD><I>A</I> = <I>A</I> is an axiom for any term <I>A</I>.

<P>
Each such axiom is implemented by simply entering the term <I>A</I> (which
has the effect of making the current equation <I>A</I> = <I>A</I>).

<P>
<DT><STRONG>symmetry:</STRONG>
<DD>if <I>A</I> = <I>B</I> is a theorem, then <I>B</I> = <I>A</I> is a theorem.

<P>
If <I>A</I> = <I>B</I> has been proved, the user can swap the left and right hand 
sides of the theorem to prove <I>B</I> = <I>A</I>.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>transitivity:</STRONG>
<DD>if <I>A</I> = <I>B</I> is a theorem and <I>B</I> = <I>C</I> is a theorem, 
then <I>A</I> = <I>C</I> is a theorem.

<P>
A sequence of rewrites which prove <I>A</I> = <I>B</I>, followed by a sequence of
rewrites which prove <I>B</I> = <I>C</I>, give a proof of <I>A</I> = <I>C</I>.

<P>
</DL>
<P>
We recall the notation <I>A</I>[<I>T</I>/<I>x</I>] for the result of substituting the
term <I>T</I> for the free variable <I>x</I> in the term <I>A</I>.  If <I>T</I> is a term
containing bound variables (or ``embedded local hypotheses'', a topic
to be discussed below), there are some technicalities to be considered
below in how the substitution is effected.

<P>
<DL>
<DD><P>
<DT><STRONG>substitution:</STRONG>
<DD>if <I>A</I> = <I>B</I> is a theorem, then 
<!-- MATH: $C[A/x] = C[B/x]$ -->
<I>C</I>[<I>A</I>/<I>x</I>] = <I>C</I>[<I>B</I>/<I>x</I>] 
is a theorem.

<P>
This is implemented by the ability to apply the theorem <I>A</I> = <I>B</I> as as
a rewrite rule, possibly repeatedly (how this is done is described in
more detail in the next subsection).

<P>
<DT><STRONG>generality:</STRONG>
<DD>if <I>A</I> = <I>B</I> is a theorem, then 
<!-- MATH: $A[C/x] = B[C/x]$ -->
<I>A</I>[<I>C</I>/<I>x</I>] = <I>B</I>[<I>C</I>/<I>x</I>] 
is a theorem.

<P>
This is implemented by the global assignment command.
