<H1> The Watson Theorem Prover </H1></CENTER>

I am developing an equational interactive theorem prover called Watson
(before 1998, Mark2).  The SML 93 source code can be seen <A
HREF="holmes/segments">here</A> (somewhat out of date), and the <A
HREF = "http://www.dina.kvl.dk/~sestoft/mosml.html">Moscow ML</A>/SML
96 source <A HREF="holmes/segments.sml">here</A>. The Moscow ML
version is usually the freshest.<P>

NEW:  I'm preparing a version using combinatory logic (and relying
on manipulations of combinators throughout); the source is <A HREF = "holmes/cl.sml">here</A> 
  and the manual is <A HREF = "holmes/clmanual.pdf"> here</A>.  This version (CL Watson) displays lambda-terms
normally, but you can view the hideous combinators that it generates
if you like that sort of thing! I think that this version is bound tobe of more theoretical interest than practical interest, but one can do things with it.  The intellectual interest arises from the fact that everything is being implemented on a very small minimal basis of concepts (which is not true in Watson, whose metatheory is rather baroque). <p> 

NEW: A different theorem proving software, based on sequent calculus
rather than equational reasoning, but also based on a version of
Quine's New Foundations as its higher order logic (essentially the
same as the logic of Watson) is found <A HREF =
"../Marcel/marcel.sml">here (ML source)</A> and <A HREF =
"../Marcel/marcelmanual.pdf">here (PDF documentation)</A>.  I am hoping to integrate the Watson approach to equational reasoning with the sequent calculus approach in this system.<p>

Version notes for Watson are found at the beginning of the source
code.  Documentation, headed by a draft of a paper on the prover, was
found here but has now been removed for copyright reasons (the paper
will appear in the Journal of Automated Reasoning).  There is on-line
documentation for the prover <A HREF =
"babydocs/node1.html">here.</A><P>

Latest official version of the source posted Feb. 18, 2001, and dated
Feb. 18, 2001.  This version has some new behavior dictated by the
needs of a GUI under development: there is a note on these changes in
the online command reference.<P>

Here is a file <A HREF =
"proverpackage.tar.gz">proverpackage.tar.gz</A> which contains
an essentially complete release of the prover, with source files,
documentation, and lots of theory files.  Newly updated Feb. 18,
2001.<P>

Draft versions of the prover not yet officially adopted may be found
<A HREF= "segments.sml">here</A>.  This is currently the same
as the official version (Feb. 18).<P>

This work was supported by a grant from the Army Research Office (the
second so far).  Another grant from the Army Research Office (recently
ended) has supported a separate project using Mark2 at the University
of Idaho.  <P>

<H2>Other theorem proving systems</H2>

If you'd like to find web resources on other theorem proving systems,
here is a <A HREF = "http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/digimath/index.html">
list of systems for computer implementation of mathematics</A>
(including but not limited to theorem provers) prepared by <A HREF =
"http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek">Freek Wiedijk</A>, whose <A HREF =
"http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/aut/index.html">implementation of
Automath</A> deserves notice.<P>

<H2>Precursors of this system</H2>

Here is a <A HREF = "babystuff.html">page</A> with discussion of the
differences between Watson and Mark2.  (This is quite old; it goes back 
to the time of the first version of Watson (summer 1998).)<P>

A paper on the logic <A HREF = "holmes/extfn.ps"> EFT </A> which
underlay an old version of the prover and is still relevant to some
aspects of the current prover is available.  The quite different
prover EFTTP described in this paper can be obtained from the author;
it is a toy and embodies a very different approach from that
eventually taken in Watson, though the Watson approaches to term
navigation and to tactic programming are already seen.  A better paper
on the logic of Watson was presented at TPHOLs 2000, and is found in
the proceedings of that conference (see my c.v. for reference).<P>

<A HREF = "holmes/yetanother.ps">The final technical report</A> of the
first grant from the Army Research Office is here.  It discusses the
