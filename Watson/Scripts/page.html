<H1>  Overview </H1>

There is a section of <A HREF = "#me">personal data</A>, (or you can see my <A HREF =
"holmes/holmesvita.ps"> curriculum vita (with publication list) </A>)
a section on my <A HREF = "#NF"> theoretical research in Quine's "New
Foundations" and related systems </A> and a section on my theorem
prover <A HREF = "#Mark2"> Mark2 </A>.  There is access to documents
from the latter two sections.  A new section on <A HREF = "#QED"> QED
</A> is under construction.<P>

Try the new <A HREF = "holmes/nf.html"> New Foundations home page </A>!

If you want to send mail to me at <A

<P>

If you get here the wrong way and none of the local links seem to
work, despair not: click <A HREF =
"http://math.boisestate.edu/faculty/holmes.html"> here </A> and things
should improve dramatically.
<P>

Here is an extended <A HREF="holmes/finsler.ps"> draft of a review
</A> of a recent book about the set theory of Paul Finsler.

<P>
Here is a brief <A HREF="holmes/setletter.txt">letter</A> I recently
wrote containing some speculations about what exactly a "set" may be
and the reasons why the "paradoxes" are not problems with the nature
of reality but mistakes in reasoning on our part.  This is just a
promissory note for an eventual more extended treatment of this
subject.  Related speculations can be found in my <A
HREF="http://www.math.ucl.ac.be/cahiers.html">draft set theory text</A>.  Another <A
HREF="holmes/ackermann.txt">letter</A> I wrote recently discusses the
set theory of Ackermann. Here are some not very serious notes on a <A HREF = "holmes/pocket.txt"> pocket set theory</A>.<P>  

An intermittent hobby of mine is the artificial spoken language <A
HREF = "http://www.halcyon.com/loglan/welcome.html">Loglan</A>, whose
grammar is unambiguously parsable by machine (using YACC) and
partially based on first-order logic.

<H1>  <A NAME = "NF"> New Foundations </A> </H1>

I am the manager of the NF Mailing List (nf@math.boisestate.edu).  Postings
for this list can be sent to the address given; administrative
inquiries about the list should be sent to me,
holmes@math.boisestate.edu<P>

You might want to look at my <A HREF= http://www.math.ucl.ac.be/cahiers.html> naive set theory
text</A>, which parallels Halmos's Naive Set Theory, but using
Jensen's version NFU of New Foundations (the difference is that
urelements are allowed) instead of ZFC.<P>
Try the new <A HREF = "holmes/nf.html"> New Foundations home page </A>!<P>


New LaTeX source for the latest version (with index under construction)
is found in parts here:<A HREF = "holmes/idxnaive.tex"> the parent
file </A>,<A HREF = "holmes/idxnaive1a.tex"> include file 1 (call it
idxnaive1a.tex) </A>, <A HREF = "holmes/idxnaive1b.tex"> include file
2 (call it idxnaive1b.tex) </A>, and <A HREF =
"holmes/idxnaive1c.tex"> include file 3 (call it idxnaive1c.tex)
</A>. The PostScript version built with this source is <A HREF =
"holmes/idxnaive.ps">here</A>.<P>

Notes on recent changes in the text (in the new version with index)
are found <A HREF = "holmes/idxnaivenotes.txt">here</A>.

<H1>  <A NAME = "Mark2"> Mark2 </A> </H1>

I am developing an equational interactive theorem prover called Mark2.
The SML source code can be viewed as a Postscript file <A HREF =
"holmes/printfile.ps"> here </A> or it can be seen as plain text <A
HREF="holmes/proversource.txt"> here </A>.  IMPORTANT UPDATE INFORMATION <A HREF = "holmes/version_notes.txt"> here </A>.  If you like
living dangerously, I will sometimes post <A HREF =
"holmes/sourcedraft.txt"> draft versions </A> of the source as well.
If you plan to try to learn to use Mark2, please notify me at
holmes@math.boisestate.edu so that I can notify you in turn about upgrades
(this is software under construction).  Theory files are available
from me on request.  More or less complete documentation, including
the documents posted here earlier in revised form and much new
material, is available as of Sept. 21 as <A HREF =
"holmes/newdocs.ps">Postscript</A> or as <A HREF =
"holmes/newdocs.tex">LaTeX source</A>.  This work is supported by a
grant from the Army Research Office.<P>

Another grant from the Army Research Office supports a separate
project using Mark2 at the University of Idaho.  You can find out
about it <A HREF = "http://www.cs.uidaho.edu/~flam/logic/">here</A>.

A paper on the logic <A HREF = "holmes/extfn.ps"> EFT </A> which underlay an
old version of the prover and is still relevant to some theories
implemented under the current prover is available.<P>

I think that I fulfilled my obligation to provide better documentation
in part, but the Sept. 21 documents certainly need expansion (e.g.,
more examples, more discussion of programming in the tactic language,
and a discussion of the underlying logical approach).  The <A HREF =
"holmes/version_notes.txt"> version notes </A> file will also contain
information on documentation updates.<P>

Some useful scripts (you should get all of them, because some call
others): 

<UL>

<LI> <A HREF = "holmes/omnibus.mk2">omnibus.mk2</A>: My current
universal script. 

<LI> <A HREF = "holmes/structural.mk2">structural.mk2</A>: Structural
tactics (composition, conversion, localization of tactics).  Now
contains a tactic EVERYWHERE for global applications of theorems as
rewrite rules (with some restrictions).

<LI> <A HREF = "holmes/typestuff.mk2">typestuff.mk2</A>: Tactics for
managing type labels.

<LI> <A HREF = "holmes/lambda.mk2">lambda.mk2</A>: Tactics which allow
conversion of abstraction terms to a form with fake binding variables
and back.

<LI> <A HREF = "holmes/logicdefs.mk2">logicdefs.mk2</A>: Definitions
of first-order logic operations from the built-in logic of case
expressions.  Now contains a tactic TAUT for simplifying complex case
expressions, used in the next file.

<LI> <A HREF = "holmes/tableau.mk2">tableau.mk2</A>: Develops a much
better (and better documented) tautology checker NEWTAUT, which should
eventually replace the one used to prove the Gries axioms in
logicdefs2.mk2.

<LI> <A HREF = "holmes/logicdefs2.mk2">logicdefs2.mk2</A> The full
version of the demo file above reengineered to work from the axioms of
the logicdefs script.  A tactic is used to prove Parvin's original
axioms.  The duality tactic is now fixed.  The latest version fixes
errors reported earlier. 

<LI> <A HREF ="holmes/naturals.mk2">naturals.mk2</A>: Beginnings of a
theory of natural numbers, interfaced with the built-in arithmetic of
the prover.  Naturals are implemented as a subtype of reals; Peano
axioms and elementary algebra of reals are provided and some simple
theorems are proved.  The built-in natural number arithmetic is interfaced
with the natural number theory.

<LI> <A HREF = "holmes/algebra.mk2">algebra.mk2</A>: theorems of basic
algebra, embedded in "naturals".

<LI> <A HREF = "holmes/imptocond.mk2">imptocond.mk2</A> and <A HREF =
"holmes/alvesfossproof.mk2">alvesfossproof.mk2</A> are scripts due to Jim
Alves-Foss, proving a useful logical lemma and some simple theorems
about order on the natural numbers, respectively.

<LI> <A HREF = "holmes/quantifiers.mk2">quantifiers.mk2</A> contains
basic theorems about the universal quantifier.  You should put an
appropriate header on this yourself; it requires logicdefs2, but
running logicdefs2 takes a while; you might prefer to have a saved
theory file to load at the beginning of the script, or to run it after
loading such a theory file.<P>  

Now contains (new) tactics implementing a tableau style of proof for
first-order logic, with examples!

<LI> <A HREF = "holmes/algebra2.mk2">algebra2.mk2</A>: Some more
algebra theorems.  This file requires logicdefs2.mk2.


<LI> <A HREF = "holmes/evenodd.mk2">evenodd.mk2</A>:  Two theorems
about even and odd numbers; examples of extended induction proofs.


</UL>

The files should be given the indicated names, since some invoke others. <P>

<H1>  <A NAME = "QED"> QED </A> </H1>

QED is a project to build a database of formalized mathematics.  One
aspect of this project is the development of standards to make it
possible for users of different theorem proving systems to share
proofs and results.  I provide the report on my talk on <A HREF =
"holmes/undef"> undefined terms </A> at the last QED workshop and a
very rough set of comments on <A HREF = "holmes/reportonmetalogic">
the QED meta-logic </A>.
