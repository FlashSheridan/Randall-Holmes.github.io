You can now have fun with my type checker for the ramified theory of
types.  The following files are provided:<p>

<a href="rtt.sml">http://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/holmes/rtt.sml</a></p><p>

SML source.  probably inscrutable if you aren't me, though
there are comments.</p><p>

<a href="rttdemo.sml">http://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/holmes/rttdemo.sml</a></p><p>

Demonstration file.  It can be executed but is really meant to
be read -- it contains an explanation of the syntax for propositional
functions that I use (but you should look at the subsequent
paper for additional info about variable binding, which is rather
peculiar!) and then contains examples of checker commands
with their expected output.</p><p>

The first draft of a paper on the formalization of RTT (and a related
simple type theory).  The paper is now basically complete, though I
think it still needs a little polish.</p><p>

<p>



In the SML source, there is also source and some examples of
the RTT proof checker under construction, but I'm not talking
about that quite yet.</p><p>

There is an NFP connection...</p><p>

This work was inspired by my reading of an now published paper of
Kamareddine, Nederpelt, and Laan, though the approach I take to
formalizing the type theory of the ramified theory of types is quite
different from theirs.  I use a modified form of their formalized
syntax for RTT.</p><p>
