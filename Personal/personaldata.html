A new political piece by Jesse, in my opinion quite brilliant (a bitter
comment on a well-known song):</p><p>

this by clicking the link: download the target of the link, then run
it, and it will work.  It is a rather large .wmv file.  UPDATE:  it

You can see Jesse's political ads (but you have to download them:  for 
reasons I can't determine, they won't play when the link is clicked, 
again, under IE they do play when clicked):</p><p>

You can look at pictures of the Holmes family and associates in our newly
constructed Sukkah, on Sukkot (the Feast of Tabernacles), 2004.</p><p>

A demented creation of mine, now reimplemented for Windows 98 (a
subdirectory contains a very partial implementation for Windows XP
which will NOT work without additional effort), is a dungeon adventure
game in the style of Zork written entirely in DOS batch files.  A
version compressed with WinZip is found <a href="ddos.zip">here</a>.  This is already a new release
(version 0.2, Sept. 18, 2003):  the major change is that there
is now a README file with lots of info about installing and
playing the game in the top directory, so I don't need to include
extensive remarks here.  There are some changes in functionality as
well, but not major ones (the output of player commands is prettier).
I will comment that the game expects to be installed as a folder
with path C:\windows\desktop\ddos, and if it isn't the ddos
environment variable set in commands\setup.bat needs to be reset.
If you have any questions, or if you have created any new objects
or monsters after trying it out (my children did this quite spontaneously),
feel free to communicate with me.  Added June 2020:  I am really not sure whether this can be made to work.  If someone does get it to work, tell me!</p><p>

Here is <a href="befunge">an interpreter and debugger for
Befunge</a> written in Logo.  It runs under Berkeley Logo and MSWLogo
(the latter is better).  It isn't documented yet (you will have to
read the files to figure out what they do -- the file is a text file
with Logo source).  It allows one to edit and run Befunge programs in
the same environment.  At the moment what is implemented is the
Befunge 93 command set on tori of arbitrary size.  The editing is
character-by-character at the moment, but it does allow use of the
instruction vector to type in any cardinal direction; I plan to
enhance the editor.  I also intend to expand the Befunge 93
instruction set somewhat.  This version crashes Berkeley Logo
eventually, for reasons apparently having nothing to do with its
correctness as an interpreter; I modified variable names so that it
would work in MSWLogo and it works fine there.  A new version has been
uploaded (Sept. 26) which fixes a number of bugs but still isn't
documented.  You can't win: funges are harder to read in the MSWLogo
format. Loading from files is now supported (uploaded Sept. 25), but
not saving to files.  There is still a complete lack of documentation.
Eventually, I will install a command with some name like "fungehelp"
which will give information.</p><p>

Here's an interesting <a href="http://www.setgame.com/">educational game</a>.</p><p>

An intermittent hobby of mine is the artificial spoken language <a href="http://www.loglan.org/">Loglan</a>, whose
grammar is unambiguously parsable by machine (using YACC) and
partially based on first-order logic.  <a href="www.lojban.org"> Lojban </a> is a closely
related language with better Web resources (Ido to Loglan's
Esperanto).</p><p>


I wrote in the early 1990's "I think that the most interesting historical development going on now is the progress of the European Union":  I am saddened by developments since.<p>

I just found out during my last update (well, that was a long time ago) that <a href="http://belgium.fgov.be/pa/ena_frame.htm">Belgium</a>, a country
I am very fond of, is
the homeland of the <a href="http://www.smurf.com">Smurfs</a> of whom I am also very
fond.  I'm afraid I couldn't resist...my apologies to all serious
people!</p><p>
