 The gentlemen in question...

This is first introduced as of 8/19/2018.<p>

Here I present a concrete implementation of the program suggested by my notes on Frege which have appeared on my web page for
  some time:  <a href="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io/Gottlob/fregenote.pdf">Here</a> find an outline of how to fix the foundational system of Frege 
  using stratification in the style of Quine.  <a href="https://randall-holmes.github.io/Gottlob/frege2.pdf">Here</a> 
  find another approach to the same subject.  It is important to note that the idea of repairing Frege's system 
  by imposing stratification was first proposed by Nino Cocchiarella, though the details of what we do here are entirely our own.

<p><a href="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io/Gottlob/gottlob.pdf">Here</a> find the documentation and  
  <a href="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io/Gottlob/gottlob.sml">here</a> the Moscow ML 2.01 source for 
  the Gottlob theorem prover.  As an exercise in literate programming, the source differs by one character from
the LaTeX source for the documentation (in which the source appears in full as verbatim blocks).

<p> <a href="http://Randall-Holmes.github.io/Gottlob/fregebook.sml">Here</a> find the commands implementing 
  as much of Frege's book as I have processed so far.  
  <a href="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io/Gottlob/testify2.gob">Here</a> is the same development 
  in the form of a much more informative log file generated by Gottlob.<p> For the log file shown to be visually 
    informative, you need to be using UTF-8 encoding and ideally a constant width font (achievable in Notepad and 
    in common browsers).  The script files produced directly by Gottlob use code page 437 (Western European/OEM-US 
    in Notepad++ encoding list) and cannot be read successfully in Notepad (they still work as scripts:  
    the visual issues occur in ML comments).
