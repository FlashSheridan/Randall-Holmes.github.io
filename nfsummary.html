I am the manager of the NF Mailing List (nf@math.boisestate.edu): the
latest information about the mailing list is found on the New
Foundations home page.<p>

I manage the <a href="https://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/holmes/nf.html"> New Foundations Home Page
</a>, where you should look for enlightenment about this subject!   I have just updated it after a hiatus (March 2005)</p><p>

A new draft paper about defining equality in NF and related systems
is <a href="https://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/holmes/define_equality.ps"> here (Postscript) </a>  and
<a href="https://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/holmes/define_equality.tex"> here (Latex source) </a>. </p><p>

I have written a book, <strong> Elementary Set Theory with a Universal
Set </strong>, which <strong> HAS APPEARED </strong> as <a href="http://www.lofs.ucl.ac.be/cnrl/Cahiers/Cahier10.html"> no. 10 </a> in
the <a href="http://www.lofs.ucl.ac.be/cnrl/Cahiers/Cahiersangl.html"> Cahiers
Series
</a> of the Center for Logic in the department of philosophy at the
Catholic University of Louvain (but the book is now out of print:  see the next paragraph).  See <a href="https://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/holmes/booknote"> here
</a> for a local file with order information, or look at the Cahiers
site.  This book is roughly parallel to Halmos's <strong> Naive Set
Theory </strong> but the development is carried out in NFU (New
Foundations with urelements) instead of ZFC.  Earlier electronic
versions of the book contain various inaccuracies and infelicities;
please consider getting the final version!  There are of course some
residual inaccuracies and infelicities, here humbly noted in an <a href="https://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/errata.txt">errata list</a>.  Here is the Postscript version
of a draft of the <a href="https://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/errata_slip.ps">errata slip</a>.</p><p>

With the permission of the publishers, the book is now posted online
<a href="https://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/holmes/head.ps">here</a>.  This is an ad hoc corrected version;
there will be an official second edition online eventually.</p><p>

Some letters to the FOM list about topics related to NF are accessible
from the <a href="https://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/index.html"> "top" </a> of my web page.
