I was the manager of an NF Mailing List at {\tt nf@diamond.boisestate.edu} but our web rulers 
  decided they didn't want us to host it.  I do have a plan to create a new forum for NF discussion.<p>
  

I manage the <a href="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io/nf.html"> New Foundations Home Page
</a>, where you could look for enlightenment about this subject if I had updated it anytime recently...
  I am planning to work on this.</p><p>

I have written a book, <strong> Elementary Set Theory with a Universal
Set </strong>, which <strong> HAS APPEARED </strong> as <a href="http://www.lofs.ucl.ac.be/cnrl/Cahiers/Cahier10.html"> no. 10 </a> in
the <a href="http://www.lofs.ucl.ac.be/cnrl/Cahiers/Cahiersangl.html"> Cahiers
Series
</a> of the Center for Logic in the department of philosophy at the
Catholic University of Louvain (but the book is now out of print:  see the next paragraph).  See <a href="https://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/holmes/booknote"> here
</a> for a local file with order information, or look at the Cahiers
site.  This book is roughly parallel to Halmos's <strong> Naive Set
Theory </strong> but the development is carried out in NFU (New
Foundations with urelements) instead of ZFC.  Earlier electronic
versions of the book contain various inaccuracies and infelicities;
please consider getting the final version!  There are of course some
residual inaccuracies and infelicities, here humbly noted in an 
  <a href="https://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/errata.txt">errata list</a>.</p><p>

With the permission of the publishers, the book is now posted online
<a href="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io/head.pdf">here</a>.  This is an ad hoc corrected version;
there will be an official second edition online eventually.</p><p>
