The majority of the changes are in the word lists in the appendices. The formatting has been changed for the sake of reasonable HTML style, but is otherwise close to the original. </P><P>This edition does not discuss changes to the structure of the language since 1989. For a record of such changes, please refer to the <CITE>Loglan 1 Updater</CITE>, compiled by Kirk Sattley and available at <A HREF="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/KirkSattley/updater.htm">http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/KirkSattley/updater.htm</A>. </P><P>These pages make extensive use of tables to format the examples and therefore require an HTML 3 compatible browser. Since HTML 3 has been standard since 1996, that shouldn't be a hardship for most people.</P><P>In order to conform to reasonable HTML style, certain compromises have been made.</P><UL>	<LI>Emphasized text which was <U>underlined</U> in the paper edition is now 	marked with the <EM>emphasize</EM> tag ("<SAMP>&lt;EM&gt;</SAMP>") and will appear as italics in many browsers. Note that Sections <A HREF="chap2.html#sec2.10">2.10</A> and <A HREF="chap6.html#sec6.14">6.14</A> discuss using underlines for special purposes, even though those underlines may now appear as italics.	<LI>Names of books and magazines which were <B>boldface</B> in the paper 	edition are now marked with the <CITE>citation</CITE> tag	("<SAMP>&lt;CITE&gt;</SAMP>") and will appear as italics in many browsers.	<LI>Certain "oddball" characters had to be dealt with:	<UL>		<LI>Elements of the "Latin 1" character set, like '&uuml;' and '&reg;', were encoded with the usual HTML "escape codes".		<LI>Greek letters, International Phonetic Alphabet symbols, and some mathematical symbols were replaced with inline graphics		<LI>Arrows for a mathematical "implies" and "iff" were replaced by ASCII equivalents ("--&gt;", "&lt;--&gt;")		<LI>Over-struck characters (for the Loglan zeros <B>mo</B> and <B>ma</B>) were replaced with inline graphics		<LI>The "low hyphen" discussed in <A HREF="chap3.html#sec3.17">Section 3.17</A> was replaced by an underscore. (Anything else was considered too unpredictable in HTML.)	</UL>	Although using inline graphics for certain characters somewhat sacrifices the platform independence of these documents, they are rare enough so that it shouldn't impinge on readability.	<LI>Page numbers were ignored. The page numbers that remain in the Table of Contents only refer to the paper edition.	<LI>Words that were hyphenated for the sake of page formatting were unhyphenated. 	<LI>Line breaks were occasionally added to improve readability.</UL><P>Please note that while chapters 2-6 and the appendices were prepared from the original files and ought to be immune to spelling errors that aren't in the original text, chapters 1,7, the front matter, and the bibliography were prepared with optical character recognition software which might have introduced additional errors.</P><P>All deliberate differences between this edition and the book are marked with HTML comments (which are invisible in the browser.) If you think you've found a mistake, be sure to look at the HTML source to see if it's deliberate.</P><P>While I have tried to be careful, certain errors are bound to creep in. Many thanks to Charles Gray for tracking down a lot of these. I would appreciate hearing about any additional errors you find, as well as any other constructive suggestions. Many thanks.</P><P>James Jennings<BR>1999</P><P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="index.html#toc">(Return to the Table of Contents)</A></P></BODY></HTML>
